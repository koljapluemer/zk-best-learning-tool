<p>The majority of Wooden's scolds are embedded with instructions, in a form of statement so characteristic we called the category "Wooden." These are combination, complex statements in which the Coach simultaneously scolds and then specifically reinstructs: "I have been telling some of you for three years not to wind up when you pass the ball: Pass from the chest!" Perhaps the example of greatest artistry is his use of modeling. His demonstrations are rarely longer than 3 seconds, but are of such clarity that they leave an image in memory much like a text-book sketch. This modeling most often takes place during patterned offense drills, or half-court scrimmage, when Wooden will whistle-down play, demonstrate the correct way to perform an act (M+), and then imitate the incorrect way the player has just performed (M-). He then remodels the M+. This sequence of M+, M-, M+ is Wooden's typical pattern, and appears to be an extraordinarily effective way of providing both feedback and discrimination training. (Tharp &amp; Gallimore, unpublished manuscript, 1975) </p>

<p>He studied each individual very carefully so he could anticipate what his students would do—or fail to do—and he was primed and ready to instantly respond with one of those brief, information-packed instructions</p>
