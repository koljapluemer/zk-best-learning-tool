Hirsh &amp; Nation (1992) identify a 2000 "word-family" vocabulary size as a threshold at which many authentic L2 texts suddenly become comprehensible; Nation &amp; Hwang (1995) point out that this is roughly equivalent to West's General Service List (1953). Meara (verbal seminar contribution) claims a second threshold at 5000 words, though on unspecified grounds.</em> </p>

<p><em>Similarly, Van Ek, in his European-Community-wide Threshold Level syllabus specification (1973), proposes a vocabulary of 1500-2000 words as "adequate" for communication in an L2 environment. In listening, he defines the adequacy threshold as the ability to grasp the gist of utterances; and in speaking, as the ability to get a message across.</em> </p>

<p><em>&gt; Foreign-language learning - like the learning of most highly-complex skills, perhaps -seems to fall into two distinct phases. The first, <span class="dead-link" title="Broken link: "skill-getting" phase">"skill-getting" phase</span> can be a hard, uphill slog, especially by oneself. Classrooms and teachers can make the journey easier. Teach-yourself packages, though not bad in themselves, can replace the instruction side of the classroom experience, but not the vital support networks that keep the learner learning - hence the poor prognosis for self-instruction at this phase. One passes a threshold to the second, <span class="dead-link" title="Broken link: "skill-using" phase">"skill-using" phase</span> when one finds oneself able to take part in real-life interactions and understand real texts, especially in listening mode.</em> </p>
