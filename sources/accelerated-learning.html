<li dir="auto"><em>Part-Task Training vs. Whole-Task Training,</em> The decision whether to base training around doing the whole task at once, or to break down a complex task into parts first.

<p dir="auto">Students tend to use hastily formed “concrete” (that is, superficial) problem representations. Experts use “abstract” representations that rely on “deep” knowledge; that is, imaginal and conceptual understanding of functional relations and physical principles that relate concepts (e.g., in the case of experts at mechanics, principles such as conservation of energy). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">695</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">When experts approach familiar problems, their responses do not tend to be from an analytical or deliberative process as is the case for non-experts (Sternberg &amp; Frensch, 1992). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">699</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">There is, as there should be, room for contextual adjustment in the definition with regard to the specification of “superior.” One can conceive of superiority in a number of ways: effectiveness, efficiency, or work process quality, all of which are likely to be situationally determined. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">707</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Table 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Some features of high proficiency The expert is highly regarded by peers. The expert’s judgments are accurate and reliable. The expert’s performance shows consummate skill (i.e., more effective and/or qualitatively different strategies) and economy of effort (i.e., more efficient). For simple, routine activities, experts display signs of “automaticity” where the expert seems to be carrying out a task without significant cognitive load and conscious processing is reserved for strategic control and/or more complex activities. The expert possesses knowledge that is fine-grained, detailed and highly organized. The expert knows that his knowledge is constantly changing and continually contingent. The expert forms rich mental models of cases or situations to support sensemaking and anticipatory thinking. The expert is able to create new procedures and conceptual distinctions. The expert is able to cope with rare and tough cases. The expert is able to effectively manage resources under conditions of high stakes, high risk and high stress. Typically, experts have special knowledge or abilities derived from extensive experience with subdomains. The expert has refined pattern perception skills and can apprehend meaningful relationships that non-experts cannot. Experts are able to recognize aspects of a problem that make it novel or unusual, and will bring special strategies to bear to solve “tough cases.” — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">716</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Many studies have revealed various strategies and heuristics that experts create and rely upon (Hoffman, 2007; Lajoie, 2003). This clearly distinguishes higher from lower levels of proficiency. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">754</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">novices and apprentices tend to rely on superficial features and rote procedures whereas more proficient individuals apprehend the underlying relational structure, the constraints, and the pertinent principles (Carlson, 1990; Chi, Glaser, &amp; Rees, 1982; Egan &amp; Schwartz, 1973; Larkin, 1981; Reed, Dempster, &amp; Ettinger, 1985). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">755</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">In simple terms, one can think of automaticity as the idea that knowledge or skill undergoes a “declarative-to-procedural shift” or becomes “routinized” (Anderson, 1987). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">766</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">In a number of cognitive theories, developmental levels are defined entirely in terms of the development of automaticity and a reliance on implicit knowledge; that is, procedural and/or experiential knowledge and perceptual skills rather than explicit or declarative knowledge (e.g., Benner, 1984; Charness &amp; Campbell, 1988; Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 1986; Fitts, 1964; Fitts &amp; Posner, 1967; Gordon, 1992; Norman, 1987; Rasmussen, 1986). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">767</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic proficiency categories based on the traditional craft guild terminology (adapted from Hoffman, 1998) Naïve One who is ignorant of a domain. Novice Literally, someone who is new—a probationary member. There has been some (“minimal”) exposure to the domain. Initiate Literally, someone who has been through an initiation ceremony—a novice who has begun introductory instruction. Apprentice Literally, one who is learning—a student undergoing a program of instruction beyond the introductory level. Traditionally, the apprentice is immersed in the domain by living with and assisting someone at a higher level. The length of an apprenticeship depends on the domain, ranging from about one to 12 years in the craft guilds. Journeyman Literally, a person who can perform a day’s labor unsupervised, although working under orders. An experienced and reliable worker, or one who has achieved a level of competence. It is possible to remain at this level for life. Expert The distinguished or brilliant journeyman, highly regarded by peers, whose judgments are uncommonly accurate and reliable, whose performance shows consummate skill and economy of effort, and who can deal effectively with certain types of rare or “tough” cases. Also, an expert is one who has special skills or knowledge derived from extensive experience with subdomains. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">794</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Master Traditionally, a master is any journeyman or expert who is also qualified to teach those at a lower level. A master is one of an elite group of experts whose judgments set the regulations, standards or ideals. Also, a master can be that expert who is regarded by the other experts as being “the” expert, or the “real” expert, especially with regard to subdomain knowledge. Proficiency — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">816</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">A proficiency scale for a given domain should be based on more than one of the four general types of method listed in Table 3.4, and ideally should be based on at least three. This has been referred to as the “three legs of a tripod” (Hoffman, Ford, &amp; Coffey, 2000; Hoffman &amp; Lintern, 2006). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">851</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Expertise is achieved only after working hard on hard problems (Eccles &amp; Feltovich, 2008). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">894</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">When learners are confronted with evidence contrary to their views, they engage mental maneuvers to rationalize their faulty beliefs without fundamentally altering their views. These are the “knowledge shields.” Twenty-three of them have been identified (Feltovich et al., 2001). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">955</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">However, in a meta-analysis of 63 studies, Donovan and Radosevich (1999) found that performance post-training was somewhat better only for relatively simple tasks (e.g., rotary pursuit task) versus relatively complex tasks (e.g., air traffic control task). When these authors clustered tasks in to four different types ranging from simple physical tasks with limited mental requirement to complex tasks that required both physical and mental skills and abilities the effect size dropped from 0.97 to 0.07! Additional analyses indicated a negative correlation between effect size and overall complexity (r = −0.25, p &lt; .05) while there was no significant correlation with mental and physical requirements of the task (p &gt; .35) suggesting that increases in task complexity may eradicate the benefits of spacing practice sessions. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1023</a> </p>

<hr>
<p dir="auto">A well-known finding in research on text comprehension is that low-knowledge and high-knowledge readers learn different things and in different ways (e.g., McNamara et al., 1996). Based on a review of research on student learning from textbooks and diagrams, Mayer (2001) concluded that inexperienced learners benefit far more from instructional presentations designed to provide a better support for cognitive processes than high-knowledge learners. Less knowledgeable learners benefit from additional, integrative material whereas more knowledgeable learners do not. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1111</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">expertise reversal effect: experts are more likely to learn if they are given the opportunity to engage in exploratory problem solving that engages previously acquired schemas, whereas novices are likely to benefit from worked examples that do not involve exploratory problem solving. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1128</a> </p>

<hr>
<p dir="auto">In the literature on the learning of simple tasks, it was sometimes assumed that feedback is best when provided close in time to performance, but this is not necessarily the case. While immediate feedback may improve performance in the near-term, it can also have the opposite effect on long-term performance. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1157</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">If feedback is too frequent, it blocks important information processing activities. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1163</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">It is possible for feedback to be continuous. That is, the learning environment provides continual displays of performance indicators. This is called “dynamic assessment.” — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1190</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">elite ice skaters, Deakin and Cobley (2003) found that the highest-level skaters fell down more often while practicing specialized jumps than skaters at the level below—because they were trying things they had yet to master whereas others focused more of their time on refining the things they could perform well already. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1239</a> </p>

<hr>
<p dir="auto">Many studies that refer to transfer compare performance in a learning context to performance in a subsequent evaluation context, when the tasks or problems remain essentially the same. This meaning of “transfer”—admittedly somewhat confusing— is rather the same as the notion of durability of skill; that is, retention. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1407</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">For transfer in this sense to be effective, “the training must incorporate the complete set of transfer task requirements, including any secondary task requirements imposed” (Healy et al., 2005, p. 11). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1410</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Haskell (2001) has specified a number of different meanings of “transfer.” These are listed in Table 5.1. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1421</a> </p>

<hr>
<p dir="auto">As discussed in Chapter 4, task variability during training can produce interference and, thus, retard initial skill acquistion, but often enhances ultimate performance (Brennan et al., 2009; Schmidt, 1975; Moxley, 1979; see Healy, 2007). It is well — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1523</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Brennan et al. (2009) examined whether transfer of training would be improved by incorporating case variations during the initial training. Participants were given a visual search task of inspecting luggage for weapons. Participants were shown a series of objects with the task of distinguishing weapon from non-weapon (signal from noise). Some participants were given positive “hit sensitive” incentives (more points for correct target identification), while others were given negative “miss sensitive” incentives (deductions for incorrect target identification). A third group was given “equal cost” incentives (equal points for hits and misses), a fourth group was given no incentives (no points awarded), and a control group was self-trained and were not primed by specific targets from the experimenters. Participants were measured on their “hit rate,” “false alarm rate,” and their confidence in choices. It turned out that the control group of self-trained participants showed superior performance, demonstrating the highest hit rate and the lowest false alarm rate. They also had lower confidence on false alarms and higher confidence on hits, which is also a superior outcome. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1532</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Physical fidelity per se is not the critical feature. A substantial body of research suggests that only some aspects of the training need to be faithful to the operational setting (see Druckman &amp; Bjork, 1991). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1575</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">For instance, while the notion of overlearning was considered, it has only become clear in years since the 1960s that overlearning is a prime determinant of decay; that is, the more the overlearning, the less the decay. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1807</a> </p>

<hr>
<p dir="auto">Indeed, the experimental study of learning-decay curves marks the beginning of the experimental psychology of learning (Ebbinghaus, 1885; Hoffman et al., 1987; Woodworth, 1903, 1938a, b). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1845</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Retention of skill can be evaluated in a number of ways. One is to compare performance at the end of a training period after a retention interval during which there was no practice. This method of evaluating learning reflects performance loss. Another method is to look at the obverse, using the “method of savings:” it usually takes fewer trials or less time to re-achieve some criterion level of performance than it took originally to achieve it. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1875</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Overlearning is practice beyond the point of having reached some criterion level of performance (Driskell et al., 1992). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1969</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">In general, low ability learners and high-ability learners tend to learn different things, learn different things differently, and show different patterns of decay. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2010</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Skill at multiplying two large numbers reached a point of near-automaticity after extensive practice and showed almost no decay after a seven-month hiatus. The studies of vocabulary learning utilized the mnemonic technique called the “keyword” method, which relies on mental imagery and is known to be robust to memory decay (see Hoffman &amp; Senter, 1979). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2166</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Indeed, we put the word “tasks” in scare quotes because professional jobs do not consist solely of the performance of tasks at all, in the sense of a stepwise procedure for linking certain means to certain ends. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2258</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Orr (1996) found that “when troubleshooting complex systems, technicians tell stories because the hardest part of diagnosis is making sense out of a fundamentally ambiguous set of facts, and this is done through a narrative process to produce a coherent account” (p. 186). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2265</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">In fact, introducing desirable sources of difficulty or interference during training has been shown to be an effective way to promote retention and transfer (Healy, 2007). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2288</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Long-standing notions like zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978). or model-scaffold-fade (Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1990) suggest that instructional assistance should be greater for beginning learners and be reduced as student competence increases. Such long-standing notions and the more recent extensive experimental research on cognitive load, desirable difficulties, etc. might lead one to wonder “what’s the dilemma?” Just give novices more assistance and fade it away as they become more expert. However, current theory does not predict how much assistance to initially provide nor when and how fast to fade it.

<p dir="auto">For example, Greenstein et al. (2008) investigated the effect of “Second Life” experiences in the learning of introductory material in the physical and behavioral sciences. In learning about tsunamis and about schizophrenia, students who completed both a Second Life experience and read a handout achieved higher test scores and rated the learning experience more engaging than when they completed the handout alone. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2324</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">among engineering and software development teams, a general knowledge of cooperation strategies—that is, what to do in situations requiring cooperative behavior—is related to better performance. Cooperation is more valued by the experts than by the moderate-level performers.

<p dir="auto">highly proficient practitioners are often able to apprehend a situation and intuitively know what course of action to take. In theory, one could do a form of time compression in which one taps into a corpus of cases that present opportunities for perceptual learning, and thereby “hasten expertise” (Fadde, 2007, p. 1). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2765</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Within sports science there is a 60-year history of evidence that training in “perceptual-cognitive” skills (e.g., a baseball batter’s ability to rapidly recognize the type of pitch that was just thrown, a tennis player’s ability to recognize the type or anticipate the direction of serve, or a soccer player’s ability to anticipate the outcome of a pattern of play) can be trained using video simulations (see Ward, Williams, &amp; Hancock, 2006; Ward et al., 2008; Ward, Suss, &amp; Basevitch, 2009). Moreover, — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2772</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Ward and colleagues discuss specific paradigms that have been used over the last halfcentury to successfully train perceptual-cognitive skills in the context of sport. In the temporal occlusion paradigm, for instance, participants view a dynamic stimulus (e.g., a pattern of soccer play where the opposing team has the ball and an impending attack is developing), which is suddenly occluded (i.e., removed from view) and the trainee then has to engage in a recognition, categorization or prediction task (e.g., Ward, Suss, &amp; Basevitch, 2009). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2777</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">A considerable number of theories or approaches are manifestly pertinent to the topic of accelerated proficiency (see Chapter 5). But on close examination, not all of them fit well with what we know about expertise, and not all of them fit well with the complex and ever-changing tasks that characterize the “real world.” An example is Cognitive Load Theory. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">3409</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">The Simplifying Conditions Method (Kim &amp; Reigeluth, 1996; Reigeluth, 1999) provides an approach to the incrementation of complexity that is suited to advanced knowledge acquisition because it incrementally introduces interactions as well as “compartments” of to-be-learned material.

<p dir="auto">There is consensus on the claim that the level of proficiency or overlearning achieved during initial acquisition is the best predictor of skill decay (i.e., the more you overlearn, the less you decay). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">3602</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Following others who have used cognitive task analysis techniques with experts to develop training (see Crandall, Hoffman, &amp; Klein, 2006), the expert performance approach has been extended to include a fourth step—Expert Performance-based Training (ExPerT: Ward, Suss, &amp; Basevitch, 2009)—that leverages expert data and informal models of expertise elicited via the first two steps and data on practices that lead to superior performance in the third step, to create evidence-based training programs designed to improve performance (also see Cognitive Engineering Based on Expert Skill: Staszewski, 2008). — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">3650</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">feedback is not always helpful. The clearest example is feedback about outcome that provides no information to the learner about how to modify their process.

<p dir="auto">Scenarios have to include the sloppiness and the uncontrollability of the world if the purpose is to use the scenarios to train people or teams or organizations to be adaptive. Thus, there might be interruptions, missing information, etc. Scenarios should not be uniformly neat or “resolved.” One strategy is to make the scenario nice and neat and complete and then create versions of it, which might involve incompleteness, distractions, etc. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">4115</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Proficiency can and does continue to increase even after performance achieves some metric for competence (minimal or otherwise) on any given measure of performance.

<p dir="auto">One method that is suggestive of new possibilities is the Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau Index (CWS). This index is reminiscent of the notions of signal detection theory in that it is formed as a ratio of discrimination to inconsistency.

<p dir="auto">A retrospective study could (should) be conducted that identifies senior (or retired) experts, engages them in detailed career analysis, and captures their knowledge and reasoning skill.
