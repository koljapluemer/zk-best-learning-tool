<h2 data-heading="Core Lessons" dir="auto">Core Lessons</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Marketing takes longer than you think. You need to consistently show up, for years, with the same message. Take a room in town.</li>
<li dir="auto">Ask who you are seeking to change. Start with a very small number of people. Explicitly communicate that what you are making is for them, and not for anybody else. They will not be looking for "perfect", but for "interesting". Reminds me of <em>lack of completeness communicates "we built this for you" (source: <span class="dead-link" title="Broken link: 📰 Situated Software">📰 Situated Software</span>)</em>.
<ul>
<li dir="auto">"My product is for people who believe ＿＿＿."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Reversing that: You cannot and should not try to build a product for everyone.</li>
<li dir="auto">You will want to speak to the early adopters. People who are willing to change.</li>
<li dir="auto">Get explicit permission to market (=permission marketing).</li>
<li dir="auto">Tell a story. Be something. Have a flag.</li>
<li dir="auto">You aim to change something. You sell a new emotional state.</li>
<li dir="auto">Consider status, and how your product interact with it. Understand domination and affiliation.</li>
<li dir="auto">Ask what people would tell their friends when they buy your stuff (B2C) or their boss (B2B).</li>
<li dir="auto">The price tag was invented by the Quakers, because they believe that if everyone is created equal everyone should get the same price.</li>
</ul>
