<p dir="auto">If you tidy up in one shot, rather than little by little, you can dramatically change your mind-set. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">250</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Tidying in the end is just a physical act. The work involved can be broadly divided into two kinds: deciding whether or not to dispose of something and deciding where to put it. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">277</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Storage experts are hoarders What is the first problem that comes to mind when you think of tidying? For many, the answer is storage. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">305</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">tidy by category, not by place. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">344</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">functional—for example, when something breaks down beyond repair or when part of a set is broken. Another is to discard things that are out of date, such as clothes that are no longer in fashion or things related to an event that has passed. It’s easy to get rid of things when there is an obvious reason for doing so. It’s much more difficult when there is no compelling reason. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">466</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">These include such rules as “discard anything you haven’t used for a year,” and “if you can’t decide, pack those items away in a box and look at them again six months later.” However, the moment you start focusing on how to choose what to throw away, you have actually veered significantly off course. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">469</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Why? Because we should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">489</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">“Does this spark joy?” If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge. You may wonder about the effectiveness of such a vague criteria, but the trick is to handle each item. Don’t just open up your closet and decide after a cursory glance that everything in it gives you a thrill. You must take each outfit in your hand. When you touch a piece of clothing, your body reacts. Its response to each item is different. Trust me and try it. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">493</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">I can understand why people might be attracted to hanging their clothes. It seems like far less work. However, I strongly recommend folding as the main storage method. But it’s a pain to fold clothes and put them away in the drawer. It’s much easier to pop them on a hanger and stick them in the closet. If that’s what you’re thinking, then you haven’t discovered the true impact of folding. Hanging just can’t compete with folding for saving space. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">808</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Arrange your clothes so that they rise to the right. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">882</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">If you missed your chance to read a particular book, even if it was recommended to you or is one you have been intending to read for ages, this is your chance to let it go. You may have wanted to read it when you bought it, but if you haven’t read it by now, the book’s purpose was to teach you that you didn’t need it. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1016</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">Sorting papers Rule of thumb—discard everything — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1061</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">My clients are stunned when I say this, but there is nothing more annoying than papers. After all, they will never inspire joy, no matter how carefully you keep them. For this reason, I recommend you dispose of anything that does not fall into one of three categories: currently in use, needed for a limited period of time, or must be kept indefinitely. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1074</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">My filing method is extremely simple. I divide them into two categories: papers to be saved and papers that need to be dealt with. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1081</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Keep things because you love them—not “just because” — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1159</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Presents are not “things” but a means for conveying someone’s feelings. When viewed from this perspective, you don’t need to feel guilty for parting with a gift. Just thank it for the joy it gave you when you first received it. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1194</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">The meaning of a photo lies in the excitement and joy you feel when taking it. In many cases, the prints developed afterward have already outlived their purpose. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1317</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Picking up the pair of shoes I wore yesterday and left out in the entranceway, I say, “Thank you very much for your hard work,” and put them away in the shoe cupboard. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1401</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">trap. Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1527</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Clutter has only two possible causes: too much effort is required to put things away or it is unclear where things belong. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1529</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Never pile things: — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1554</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">I even store my laptop in the bookcase as if it were indeed a notebook. If you have storage space that should be sufficient yet falls short, try standing things vertically. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1558</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">So, empty your bag every day. This is not as bothersome as it sounds. You just need to make a place for the things inside it. Find a box and place your train pass, company ID, and other important items vertically inside it. Then put the box just like that into a drawer or cupboard. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1657</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">the bath is the most humid place in the house, which obviously makes it the most unsuitable place for storing anything. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1695</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">One of the homework assignments I give my clients is to appreciate their belongings. For example, I urge them to try saying, “Thank you for keeping me warm all day,” when they hang up their clothes after returning home. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">1806</a> </p>

<p dir="auto">say, “Thank you for giving me shelter.” — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2012</a> </p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Human beings can only truly cherish a limited number of things at one time. As I am both lazy and forgetful, I can’t take proper care of too many things. — location: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="">2156</a> </p>
