<p>What are the qualities of a territory? &nbsp; 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; A territory provides sustenance. Runners know what a territory is. So do rock climbers and kayakers and yogis. Artists and entrepreneurs know what a territory is. The swimmer who towels off after finishing her laps feels a helluva lot better than the tired, cranky person who dove into the pool thirty minutes earlier. &nbsp; 2)&nbsp;&nbsp; A territory sustains us without any external input. A territory is a closed feedback loop. Our role is to put in effort and love; the territory absorbs this and gives it back to us in the form of well-being. &nbsp; When experts tell us that exercise (or any other effort-requiring activity) banishes depression, this is what they mean. &nbsp; 3)&nbsp;&nbsp; A territory can only be claimed alone. You can team with a partner, you can work out with a friend, but you only need yourself to soak up your territory’s juice. &nbsp; 4)&nbsp;&nbsp; A territory can only be claimed by work. When <span class="dead-link" title="Broken link: Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</span> hits the gym, he’s on his own turf. But what made it his own are the hours and years of sweat he put in to claim it. </p>
